## Description:

This is a command line application that walks the user through the process of creating a professional README.md file for your github repository.

### -Motivation:

The motivation behind this project was because I wanted to make sure I could keep all of my README files consistently styled and looking professional.

### -Why This Was Built:

I built this project becasue I wanted to automate the process of making README files.

### -Problems Solved:

Using Node.js to create a new file, and write the correct contents to it.

### -What was Learned:

I learned how to use NPM to install and use a new package called inquirer. Additionally I figured out how to take user inputs to output a new file styled to fit their inputs.
